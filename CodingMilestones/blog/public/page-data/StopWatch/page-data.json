It was a fun experience that involved convincing my Windows computer to think it was a Mac! This App is a Stopwatch that has working pause/play/reset buttons. It also has a Night mode button that changes the entire view/color scheme of the app for better visibility between night and day. Although it was a single page app, it has a very nice, clean look to it's design and all the Swift code handling the stopwatch works very well.</p>"}},"heroImage":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/u96kzfvbq862/pw8FpqtN5fpu9CdMDVhsr/a8f7caea99dcb6d66b3afe11f1d3fc9d/StopWatch.png"},"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/u96kzfvbq862/pw8FpqtN5fpu9CdMDVhsr/a8f7caea99dcb6d66b3afe11f1d3fc9d/StopWatch.png?w=960&q=50"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"StopWatch"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
